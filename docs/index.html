        <p>The main concept of Guzl that there is an improved workflow for your sessions. Along with the improved workflow there are no cookies or tracking. Privacy is very important to those of us who love to guzl content.</p>

          <p>The core concept of Guzl is the setup. A setup is the order in which you browse your subreddits until you are finished.</p>
          <p>Within Guzl you can configure your own setup.</p>
